# PyTorch for One-shot segmentation
This repository contains some models for one-shot segmentation and the pipeline of training and testing models, 
implemented in PyTorch

## Models
1. Fully Convolution Network - built on VGG16
2. Fully Convolution Network - built on AlexNet
([Fully convolutional networks for semantic segmentation](http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/papers/Long_Fully_Convolutional_Networks_2015_CVPR_paper.pdf))

## Requirement
1. PyTorch 0.2.0
2. Tensorflow
3. Open CV
4. PIL
